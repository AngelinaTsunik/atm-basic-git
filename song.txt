There's one who takes it all
And there's one who takes the fall
One who never wins
And there's one who stands again
There's one who lives in pain
And there's one who has no shame
There's one to tell the lies
And one to make the alibis
Round and round and round and round we go
Where we're gonna stop nobody knows
There's one who makes the rules
And there's one to play the fool
Always a fool
One with jails hands
And there's one to be the friend
(Everybody needs one)
There's one who wins the fight
And there's one who sleeps at night
There's one who will stand tall
But we will all fall
